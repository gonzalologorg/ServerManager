_Easier than just doing a dumb bat file for windows_

## Why does this exists?

Every damn time i turn on my computer, my local IP changes (Yes, i'm aware you can configure your router to always assign to the same MAC address, and i'm tired of pretending it ever helped because it doesn't)
So basically this requests your local IP Address so you can open in batch multiple gmod copies with 66% window scale so you can test multiple clients at once, it's corny but i guess it's cool just for having fun with C#

Not much to say, open a server, closes it, open multiple clients and automatically connects into it, and just closes all clients, any settings you make here, will persist
